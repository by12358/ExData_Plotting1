The first function in the plot1.R file, ReadEnergyData(), will read in the power consumption data file
and return a clean data frame.  ReadEnergyData() will fail if the current working directory does not
contain the power consumption data file, and the data file must be called "household_power_consumption.txt".

Use the data frame returned from ReadEnergyData() as the argument to the four plot functions, plot1(), 
plot2(), plot3(), and plot4().
